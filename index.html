  <p>It's been said that when Thomas Edison was asked how it felt to fail 1,000 times at inventing the light bulb,
    he simply said, "I didn't fail, the light bulb was an invention with a 1,000 steps."</p>

  <p>In today's crowded, creative, and entitled social media job market many people forget that some things don't happen overnight.
    They take dedication, passion, and good ole' fashion grit. Intelligence is great, and a classy personality will get you far,
    but when it comes to building the technical infrastructure of the next generation, nothing more than tenacity and grit will do.
    Grit is what drives me, and passion keeps me up at night thinking about the future of Computer Science.
    The fact is, there will always be failures and setbacks; it's how you adapt and maintain your enthusiastic attitude that matters.</p>

  <p>In the Military, I was constantly faced with obstacles that seemed impossible to overcome,
    but my team always overcame, because our lives were at stake. You can be very creative with your back against the wall.
    That same passion, creativity, and belief that there is no such thing as a “no-win” scenario is what drives me today.</p>

  <p>Currently I am a second year student studying Computer Information Systems,
    with a specialization in Enterprise Computing and Database Management.
    I dream to one-day write programs that will seamlessly adapt to any device, OS, or protocol just like humanity adapts to life as it approaches.
    According to Cisco's Visual Networking Index for 2016,
    in the next 5 years the global mobile data traffic is projected to hit or exceed 30.6 Exabytes a month.
    Networks, devices, and software all need to be scaled in order to take advantage of such traffic,
    and I will be on the team that helps build that platform, one way or another.</p>
